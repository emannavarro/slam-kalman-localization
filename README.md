# SLAM Kalman Localization

**CMPE 185 Project**

Welcome to the SLAM Kalman Localization project! This repository is dedicated to implementing and testing SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques using Kalman filters. We are utilizing a submodule as a sandbox environment to experiment with various simulations.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project, you can clone the repository and initialize the submodule by using:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:emannavarro/slam-kalman-localization.git
